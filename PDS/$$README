This is the CBT Usermod Collection for ISPF (CUCI).  Each usermod is packaged
for SMP/E installation in your environment.  CUCI is designed to be integrated
directly into ISPF.  It is NOT designed to be LIBDEF'd into ISPF.  Significant
pieces of CUCI will be rendered inoperative if you attempt to LIBDEF the CUCI
elements instead of integrating them into the base ISPF.  For example, the mods
related to USRCCONF, setting ISPF defaults for settings not in ISPCCONF, require
that the ISPF Primary Option Menu be modified to handle the USRCCONF settings.
The ISPF primary option menu, and the code processing the USRCCONF settings must
be available when ISPF starts, which is impossible in a LIBDEF environment.

List of Usermods
----------------

UMBPXISJ - After selecting superuser UID(0) mode in ISHELL, exiting ISHELL does
           not reset the UID to the user's default UID.  This usermod will reset
           the user's UID to default when exiting ISHELL.

UMISCLMJ - This usermod will move SCLM modules from SISPLPA to SISPLOAD for
           VSCR in below-the-line LPA.  The SCLM modules are 24-bit and do not
           need to be in LPA.

UMISPCMJ - This usermod satisfied multiple enhancement requests for command
           abbreviations, such as DSL for DSLIST, UDL for UDLIST, etc.  The
           ISPCMDS table was also updated to enable the CD and SF commands.  CD
           can be used to change the directory in 3.17 without exiting and
           retyping the directory name.  SF is an alias for the SRCHFOR command.

UMISRHIJ - This usermod enables edit highlighting for 20 languages that
           are unsupported by ISPF, via the HIGHLITE command:

           ACS
           CARLa
           FLOWASM
           FORTRAN
           Go
           JAVA
           JavaScript
           JSON
           Kotlin
           PANELX
           Perl
           PHP
           PYTHON
           R
           RUBY
           SAS
           SHELL
           SQL
           TypeScript
           XMLASCII

UMISRPDJ - Panel ISRUAASE has a bug where if the user specified a PDSE version 1
           and a non-zero number of member generations, the panel would set the
           number of member gens to 0 and allocate a PDSE V1.  If the user
           wanted a PDSE V2 with member gens, they would have to delete the PDSE
           and reallocate it, perhaps making the same mistake again.  Since the
           user originally specified conflicting parms, ISRUAASE should have
           issued an error message, which would have given the user an
           opportunity to fix the error without a lot of extra work.

UMISRPXJ - ISRPX is the ISPF module that holds the keywords to be highlighted
           for each supported language for HILITE.  There are a number of COBOL
           PL/I keywords that are still not highlighted, so they are added here,
           to SISPSAMP member ISRPXASM.

UMISRUDJ - Block deletes in ISPF 3.4 are stopped dead when encountering VSAM
           files.  This usermod will process VSAM deletes without stopping,
           bypass errors for the DATA and INDEX components, and eliminates the
           TSO messages that force the user to stay at the screen and clear the
           messages.

UMISRUUJ - After selecting superuser UID(0) mode in UDLIST (ISPF 3.17), exiting
           UDLIST does not reset the UID to the user's default UID.  This
           usermod will reset the user's UID to default when exiting UDLIST.

UMISRVCJ - This usermod will prime the other DSN field on panel ISRUMVC with the
           current dataset name.  It should save some typing by providing a
           model dataset name for the user.

UMUSRCFJ - The ISRCCONF dialog does not set defaults for a large number of ISPF
           settings.  The USRCCONF dialog sets the following options:

           PF Keys and PF Key Labels
           Calendar Options
           MEMLIST, DSLIST, and UDLIST SRCHFOR Options
           UDLIST Directory List and Mount Table Options
           UDLIST Directory List Column Arrangement
           UDLIST Mount Table by File System Column Arrangement
           UDLIST Mount Table by Mount Point Column Arrangement
           Browse/View/EDIT/EDSET ISPF Options
           Miscellaneous ISPF Options

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

All the following usermods have been updated for z/OS V2R5 by default.  Since
z/OS V2R5 removed the ISPF Workstation interface, a number of panels had the
workstation pulldown menu options removed.  If you are still running z/OS V2R4,
read the instructions in each usermod to set it up for z/OS V2R4.
