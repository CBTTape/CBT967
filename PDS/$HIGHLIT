To use extended language highlighting, issue the HIGHLITE command
with the following syntax:

HIGHLITE language | OFF

language = {ACS | CARLA | FLOWASM | FORTRAN | GO | JAVA | JAVASCRIPT |
           JSON | KOTLIN | PANELX | PERL | PHP | PYTHON | R | RUBY | SAS |
           SHELL | SQL | TYPESCRIPT | XMLASCII} | OFF (turns off extended
           language highlighting).

HIGHLITE BRACE toggles brace highlighting on and off.

HIGHLITE BRACKET toggles bracket highlighting on and off.

Note:  HIGHLITE BRACE/BRACKET may show incomplete pairs if opening/closing
       brace/bracket is off the screen.

HIGHLITE DISPLAY | DISP shows current state of HIGHLITE options.

HIGHLITE HELP | ? displays this HELP text.

Note:  NULLS ON STD is required for CUCI HIGHLITE to function correctly.
       Invoking the HIGHLITE command will automatically set NULLS ON STD.
       If you use NULLS ON ALL elsewhere in EDIT, you will need to issue
       NULLS ON ALL after exiting CUCI HIGHLITE.
