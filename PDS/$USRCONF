The CUCI dialog USRCCONF, which sets defaults for ISPF settings not is ISPCCONF,
is an important addition to the colleciton.  ISPF administrators will now be
able to set defautls for the following settings not in ISPCCONF:

PF Keys and PF Key Labels
Calendar Options
MEMLIST, DSLIST, and UDLIST SRCHFOR Options
UDLIST Directory List and Mount Table Options
UDLIST Directory List Column Arrangement
UDLIST Mount Table by File System Column Arrangement
UDLIST Mount Table by Mount Point Column Arrangement
Browse/View/EDIT/EDSET ISPF Options
Miscellaneous ISPF Options

Enabling the support for these settings requires five things:

1 - Modify ISR@PRIM (or your primary option menu) to set the defaults.  An
    example is provided in the ISR@PRIM member in this library.  You can use the
    compare command while editing your ISR@PRIM member to merge the changes.
2 - Allocate a keyword file to hold the USRCCONF options.  Note:  The keyword
    file must be a PDS, and have a minimum record length of 255 for variable
    format records, and 251 for fixed format records.  For space, CYL,(1,1,45)
    should allow enough room and directory space to store multiple members for
    testing and backup purposes.  YOU CAN USE YOUR EXISTING ISPF KEYWORD FILE,
    provided you use a different member name to distinguish the USRCCONF options
    from the ISPCCONF options.
3 - Modify the USR@KYWD exec to specify the keyword file you defined in step 2.
    The file will be read at the beginning of each new TSO/ISPF session to
    determine if there is a new user, or if any settings should be FORCEd.
4 - Generate a keyword file by executing the USRCCONF dialog.  The dialog is
    designed to look and act like ISPCCONF.  Again, you can use your existing
    ISPF keyword file, but just be sure to use a different member name than the
    name you use for ISPF defaults.  I used "USRDEFLT" for testing purposes.
5 - You must APPLY the UMUSRCFJ to modify the ISPF elements.  If installing
    manually, YOU CANNOT USE LIBDEFs!  You must ensure that all the elements
    are in a library concatenated ahead of the SYSPROC and ISPxLIB libraries
    in your TSO LOGON PROC.

Future releases will add the following settings:

Entry panel options for various utility panels, such as 3.1, 3.4, etc.
