//* Tom Conley, formerly SHARE's ISPF Advocate (now defunct), is    *   FILE 967
//* establishing this collection to provide function that will in   *   FILE 967
//* all likelihoood not be provided by IBM.  IBM's investment in    *   FILE 967
//* ISPF has steadily dwindled since z/OS V2R1, while investment in *   FILE 967
//* z/OSMF has vastly increased.  There is still a user community   *   FILE 967
//* for ISPF that requires increased function.  Even with recent    *   FILE 967
//* events, where IBM reversed course and increased ISPF            *   FILE 967
//* development resources for z/OS V2R5, CUCI will continue to      *   FILE 967
//* provide extended function for ISPF wherever possible.           *   FILE 967
//*                                                                 *   FILE 967

//* Submissions to this collection should be in SMP/E usermod       *   FILE 967
